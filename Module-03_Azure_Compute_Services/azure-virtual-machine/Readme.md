# Azure Virtual Machines

## Azure Virtual Machine Overview
   - Azure Virtual Machine is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources.
   - Azure VM an IaaS
   - An Azure VM gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it.
   - You need to maintain the VM by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it

## Considerations before provisioning a Virtual Machine
   - The name of your application resources.
   - The *Location* where the resources are stored
   - The *Size* of the VM
   - The *Number of VMs* that can be created
   - The Operating system that the VM runs (Windows/Linux)
   - The configuration of the VM after it starts (extensions)
   - The related resources that the VM needs

   1) *General Purpose*
      - Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio.
      - Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers
   2) *Compute Optimized*
   3) *Memory Optimized*
   4) *Storage Optimized*
   5) *GPU*
