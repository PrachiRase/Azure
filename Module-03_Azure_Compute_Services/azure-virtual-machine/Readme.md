# Azure Virtual Machines

## Azure Virtual Machine Overview
   - Azure Virtual Machine is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources.
   - Azure VM an IaaS
   - An Azure VM gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it.
   - You need to maintain the VM by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it

## Considerations before provisioning a Virtual Machine
   - The name of your application resources.
   - The *Location* where the resources are stored
   - The *Size* of the VM
   - The *Number of VMs* that can be created
   - The Operating system that the VM runs (Windows/Linux)
   - The configuration of the VM after it starts (extensions)
   - The related resources that the VM needs

## [Azure Virtual Machine Sizes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes)
   1) *General Purpose*
      - Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio.
      - Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers
   2) *Compute Optimized*
   3) *Memory Optimized*
   4) *Storage Optimized*
   5) *GPU*
   6) *HPC*

## What is Secure Shell (SSH)?
   - Secure Shell (SSH) is an encrypted connection protocol that allows secure sign-ins over unsecured connections. 
   - SSH allows you to connect to a terminal shell from a remote location using a network connection.
   - There are two approaches we can use to authenticate an SSH connection:
     1) Username and Password
     2) SSH Key Pair

## [What are *Azure VM Extensions*?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/overview)
   - *Azure VM Extensions* are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs.
   - <b>Example</b>: if a virtual machine requires software installation, antivirus protection, or the ability to run a script inside it, you can use a VM extension.

## [*Azure Managed Disks* service for Azure VM Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types)
   - Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines.
   - Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized.
   - With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the disk size, the disk type, and provision the disk.
   - Azure Disks Roles
     1. Operating System Disks
     2. Data Disk (Persistent storage)
     3. Temporary Disk
   - Azure Disks Types
     - Ultra disk
     - Premium SSD v2
     - Premium SSD
     - Standard SSD
     - Standard HDD
   - Azure Disk Encryption
     - Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)
     - Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
     - Encryption at host
   - Disk Performance Indicators
     - IOPS
     - Throughput
     - Latency

## [Azure VM *Boot Diagnostics*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/boot-diagnostics)
   - Boot diagnostics is a debugging feature for Azure virtual machines (VM) that allows diagnosis of VM boot failures.
   - Boot diagnostics enables a user to observe the state of their VM as it is booting up by collecting serial log information and screenshots.
