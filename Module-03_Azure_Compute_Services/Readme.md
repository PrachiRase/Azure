## What are Compute services? | When to use Compute Services?
   - Azure Compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications.
   - It provides computing resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking, and operating systems.
   - The resources are available on-demand and can typically be made available in minutes or even seconds.
   - You pay only for the resources you use, and only for as long as you're using them.
   - Azure supports a wide range of computing solutions for development, testing and running applications.
   - Some of the important services are as follows:
     1) Azure Virtual Machines
     2) Azure Container Instances
     3) Azure App Service
     4) Azure Functions (serverless computing)
