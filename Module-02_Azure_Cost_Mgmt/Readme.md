# 2. Azure Cost Management and SLA

## What is [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)?
   - The Pricing calculator displays Azure products in categories.
   - You add these categories to your estimate and configure according to your specific requirements
   - You then receive a consolidated estimated price, with a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each resource you added to your solution
   - You can export or share that estimate or save it for later
     
## What is [Azure TCO Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator)?
   - The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on Azure over time, in comparision to your on-premises datacenter cost
   - With the TCO Calculator, you enter the details of your on-premises workloads and then you review the suggested industry average cost (which you can adjust) for related operational costs
   - You're then presented with a side-by-side report.

## How are services priced in Microsoft Azure?   
The service cost depends on the following factors:
   1) What types of Azure subscriptions are available?
   2) How do we purchase Azure services?
   3) Does location or network traffic affect cost?
   4) What other factors affect the final cost?

## How to minimize the cost in Azure?
   - Understand estimated costs before you deploy (using TCO and Pricing Calculator)
   - Use spending limits to restrict your spending. Ex. Quotas
   - Resize underutilized virtual machines
   - Use Azure Reservations to prepay
   - Research available cost-saving offers
   - Apply Tags to identify cost owners
   - Deallocate virtual machines during off hours
   - Use *Azure Advisor* to monitor your usage. Azure Advisor identifies unused or underutilized resources and recommends unused resources that you can remove.

## Azure Service LifeCycle

The service lifecycle defines how every Azure service is released for public use.
   1) *Development phase*
      - Every Azure service starts in the Development phase.
      - In this phase, the Azure team collects and defines its requirements, and begins to build the service.
   2) *Public preview phase*
      - During this phase, the public can access and experiment with it so that it can provide feedback.
   3) *General Availability (GA) phase*
      - After a new Azure service is validated and tested, itâ€™s released to all customers as a production-ready service.
